/*
 * heuristics.yar - v0.4.0: string & API heuristics.
 * v0.9.1: added numeric `weight` meta (see below).
 *
 * Uses YARA's built-in `elf` module to inspect the DYNAMIC SYMBOL TABLE
 * (imported functions) directly, rather than doing raw string matching -
 * this is more precise than a plain string search, since it only fires
 * on genuine imports rather than the function name appearing anywhere
 * in the file (e.g. in a string literal, a comment compiled into debug
 * info, etc.).
 *
 * IMPORTANT CAVEAT FOR YOUR REPORT: every API here has entirely
 * legitimate uses (debuggers legitimately use ptrace, package managers
 * legitimately use memfd_create, etc.) - these rules are individually
 * HIGH FALSE-POSITIVE, LOW CONFIDENCE. Real heuristic engines combine
 * signals (multiple suspicious imports together, absence of expected
 * "normal" imports, combined with behavioral/entropy signals from later
 * milestones) rather than alerting on any single import. The
 * Multiple_Suspicious_Imports rule below is a deliberately crude
 * first attempt at that combination - discuss its false-positive rate
 * honestly in your report rather than presenting single-API matches as
 * strong detections.
 *
 * WEIGHT META: avd.c no longer convicts on any single rule match - it
 * sums the `weight` meta of every matching rule and only sends
 * AV_VERDICT_MALICIOUS once the total crosses MALICIOUS_SCORE_THRESHOLD
 * (100, see avd.c). This was added after real testing killed /usr/bin/zsh,
 * /bin/sh, and /usr/bin/uwsm - all legitimate system binaries that
 * happened to import one flagged API each. The weights below are a
 * direct numeric translation of the `confidence` strings already in
 * each rule; keep the two in sync if you tune one.
 *
 * SCORING NOTE: Imports_Ptrace and Imports_Memfd_Create below are
 * `private` building blocks for Multiple_Suspicious_Imports, not
 * independent signals - avd.c's YARA callback skips private matches
 * when summing weights, so a file importing both scores 40 (the
 * compound rule alone), not 15+15+40=70.
