# Evasion Resistance Findings

## 1. Dynamic symbol resolution vs. API import heuristics

`rules/heuristics.yar`'s `Imports_Ptrace` rule checks YARA's `elf.dynsym`
table — the binary's static dynamic-symbol imports. Resolving `ptrace`
at runtime via `dlopen("libc.so.6")` + `dlsym(handle, "ptrace")` instead
of linking it directly means there's no direct import entry to find.

Verified: `objdump -T` on the evasion binary shows no `ptrace` entry, and
`yara rules/heuristics.yar` reports no `Multiple_Suspicious_Imports` match
(the only public rule that could fire - the `Imports_*` sub-rules are
`private` building blocks and never surface in CLI output or `avd` scoring).

**Interesting nuance**: the evasion technique itself isn't free —
`Imports_Dlopen` (a rule explicitly marked "very low confidence, do not
alert on this alone" since `dlopen` is ubiquitous in legitimate
software) still fires. This doesn't mean the evasion failed — `dlopen`
alone is far too common to act on — but it's a reminder that evasion
techniques can leave their own fingerprints, and a more sophisticated
engine could build a meta-heuristic specifically for "uses dynamic
symbol resolution instead of static linking for a small number of
specific functions" as its own (still weak, but non-zero) signal.

**Mitigation directions** (not implemented, discussion only): scanning
`.rodata`/string sections for the literal string `"ptrace"` alongside
the import check would catch this specific case (the string still has
to appear somewhere for `dlsym` to look it up) — though that's
defeatable too (string obfuscation, building the name character-by-
character at runtime). This is a genuine cat-and-mouse dynamic, worth
stating plainly rather than implying any static analysis is airtight.

## 2. Substantial modification vs. fuzzy hashing

Fuzzy hashing (CTPH/ssdeep) is explicitly designed to tolerate *minor*
changes — the v0.7.0 testing already showed a few appended bytes
scoring 100/100 similarity. This test checked the boundary: how much
change breaks it?

Verified: appending 50KB of random data to a ~16KB binary (roughly
tripling its size with unrelated content) dropped the similarity score
to 0/100 — full evasion, using the exact `fuzzy_compare()` call `avd.c`
uses.

**This is expected, not a bug.** CTPH is a rolling-hash, block-based
similarity measure — it's designed to detect "this is basically the
same file with small edits," not "this file shares some heritage with
that one." A well-known, honest limitation of the technique, not
specific to this implementation. Real-world malware families that get
substantially repacked/recompiled between variants will evade a
fuzzy-hash corpus check the same way, which is exactly why this project
treats fuzzy hashing as one signal among several rather than a
standalone detector.

## 3. Entropy dilution vs. entropy analysis — testing defense-in-depth

This is the most important finding of the four, because it tests the
project's core design premise directly: **does evading one layer mean
evading the engine?** The answer changed twice as the project evolved,
and the full sequence is worth documenting rather than just the final
state.

**Original result (any-match-convicts era)**: padding a UPX-packed
binary with 500KB of zero bytes dilutes the *whole-file* Shannon
entropy average below the 7.0 threshold — `entropy.yar`'s
`High_Overall_Entropy` no longer fires on the padded file. But the
same padded file was still caught by `elf_analysis.yar`
(`No_Section_Headers` + `Entry_Point_Outside_Text`), since padding with
zero bytes doesn't restore the section headers UPX stripped. **Evading
the entropy check did not evade the engine.**

**Regression (v0.9.1 weighted-scoring era)**: after real testing killed
`zsh`/`sh`/`uwsm` on single weak matches and the detection logic moved
to summed rule weights against a 100-point threshold, the same
evasion sample was re-scored: `No_Section_Headers`(55) +
`Entry_Point_Outside_Text`(30) = **85**, below the new threshold. The
fix for one real problem (false positives from single weak matches)
silently broke this finding — evading entropy analysis now evaded the
*whole pipeline*, not just one layer. This is a direct, mechanical
tradeoff, not a coincidence: making conviction harder in general makes
every individual evasion easier by the same amount.

**Fix (override tier)**: rather than choosing between "some false
positives" and "some false negatives" as a global setting, a small,
deliberately narrow set of rules — verified against both real positive
and negative samples, with no known false-positive history —
now carry `override = true` and convict on their own regardless of
aggregate score. `No_Section_Headers` and `Executable_Stack` qualify;
`Entry_Point_Outside_Text` (the rule that actually false-positived on
`uwsm`) and `Has_RWX_Segment` (never verified against a real sample)
deliberately do not. Re-scored: `No_Section_Headers` alone now
convicts via override, restoring the original conclusion — the
numeric score is still 85/100 (override doesn't change the weight
sum), but `override=1` means it convicts regardless of the number.

The real lesson here isn't "the engine is robust" — it's that a fix
for one failure mode (false positives) can silently reintroduce a
different one (false negatives) if you don't re-run your adversarial
tests after every change to the scoring logic. Evasion testing is not
a one-time checkbox; it needs to be re-run whenever detection logic
changes, and this finding is the concrete proof of why.

## 4. Slow-drip modification vs. rapid-write behavioral heuristic

**Update (post-`v0.8.1`/`sliding_window_note()`): re-verified live
against the current module. The specific discrete-reset bug described
below is fixed. A related but distinct evasion — deliberately pacing
bursts with gaps beyond the window size — still succeeds in the tested
configuration, and, unlike the bug, is not fixable by any finite
windowed counter. Both results below are from real `dmesg` captures,
not code-path inference.**

`behavior.c`'s rapid-write counter originally used a **fixed window**,
not a true sliding window:

```c
if (e->window_start_jiffies == 0 || window_ms > WRITE_OPEN_WINDOW_MS) {
    e->window_start_jiffies = jiffies;  /* window resets ENTIRELY */
    e->write_open_count = 1;
} else {
    e->write_open_count++;
    ...
}
```

Once more than 2 seconds had passed since the window started, the
counter reset to 1 regardless of how many writes happened, discarding
even genuinely recent activity the instant a reset landed. This wasn't
only an adversarial-pacing problem: a steady, non-adversarial write
stream that happened to straddle a reset boundary could lose its own
accumulated progress with no deliberate evasion involved.

**This part is now fixed.** `sliding_window_note()` replaced the
discrete reset with a real trailing window — each tracked write now
carries its own timestamp and individually ages out after
`WRITE_OPEN_WINDOW_MS`, rather than the whole window being wiped in
bulk on a boundary crossing. Verified live (see the fix's own PR): a
steady ~66 files/sec stream (150 distinct files, ~15ms apart, spanning
past the old 2000ms reset point with no pauses) now correctly trips at
exactly the 51st distinct file — the old implementation could not have
caught this, since it would have reset mid-stream and needed 50 fresh
events after the reset within the little time remaining.

**What's still not fixed — and can't be, by a windowed counter alone**:
re-running `tests/evasion/test_slow_drip_evasion.sh` (40-file bursts,
5 bursts, paced 2.1s apart — 100ms *beyond* the 2-second window, not
merely at it) against the current sliding-window implementation still
produces **no** `rapid file modification` kill in `dmesg`, despite 200
files modified in total. This is not the discrete-reset bug
reappearing: `sliding_window_note()` retains an entry while
`age <= window_ms` (inclusive - see its comment/implementation in
`behavior.c`), so it legitimately forgets a write only once that
write's age strictly exceeds `WRITE_OPEN_WINDOW_MS`. That's what makes
it a rate counter instead of a lifetime counter, and it means this
specific finding is narrower than "pacing at or above the window
evades" - it's specifically pacing *beyond* the window that does, in
this tested configuration (this 2.1s gap, `WRITE_OPEN_THRESHOLD`'s
current value); an adversary pacing exactly at the boundary would
still land inside the inclusive `<=` and get counted. The generalizable
point isn't about this exact configuration, though: it's that *any*
positive, finite window/threshold pair - sliding or fixed, whatever
their specific values - remains evadable by pacing slowly enough
relative to *that* configuration. No amount of window-size or
threshold tuning closes this off entirely, only shifts where the
evasion threshold sits; doing so would require a different class of
mechanism (e.g. tracking total volume over a much longer horizon, or a
behavioral signal beyond simple event counting). Worth stating
precisely: the implementation bug is gone; the inherent limitation of
finite counting-based rate limiting is not, and isn't something this
design can fully close.

## Overall takeaways for the report

- Every individual detection layer has a known, demonstrable evasion.
  This is expected and honest — no single technique here is claimed to
  be unbeatable, and presenting them as if they were would be the
  wrong takeaway.
- The one deliberately-designed defense (layering independent checks)
  held up under direct testing (finding #3) — evading entropy analysis
  did not evade the structural analysis running alongside it.
- Finding #4 is the one case where re-testing after a fix actually
  changed the picture, and it changed it in an instructive way: the
  *implementation* half (discrete-reset window) had a known, named
  structural fix (true sliding window) and re-verification confirmed
  it closed - but doing so exposed the *inherent* half underneath
  (deliberate pacing at or under the rate limit) as the same category
  of unfixable-by-this-technique-alone limitation as #1 and #2, not
  something the sliding-window fix was ever going to reach. Worth
  distinguishing "we ran out of scope" from "this is as good as this
  approach gets" when discussing each finding - and, per #4, worth
  re-checking that distinction after a fix lands rather than assuming
  it once and leaving it stated.
